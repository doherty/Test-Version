NAME
    Test::Version - check for VERSION information in modules

VERSION
    version 0.03

  VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Test::Version, released 18
    November 2002.

  SYNOPSIS
    use Test::Version;

    plan tests => $num_tests;

    version_ok( $file );

  DESCRIPTION
    THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE.

    Check files for VERSION information in perl modules. Inspired by brian d
    foy's Test::Pod (see Test::Pod).

  FUNCTIONS
    version_ok( FILENAME, [EXPECTED, [NAME] ] )
        version_ok requires a filename and returns one of the three values:

            NO_FILE       Could not find the file
            NO_VERSION    File had no VERSION information
            VERSION_OK    VERSION information exists

        version_ok okays a test without an expected result if it finds
        VERSION information, or if an expected result is specified and it
        finds that condition. For instance, if you know there is no VERSION
        information,

            version_ok( $file, NO_VERSION );

        When it fails, version_ok will show error information.

        The optional third argument NAME is the name of the test which
        version_ok passes through to Test::Builder. Otherwise, it choose a
        default test name "VERSION test for FILENAME".

  CAVEATS
    Currently only checks files ending in '.pm', and expects the package
    name to match the filename. I'm open to suggestions for more robust
    parsing.

  BUGS
    Likely so. Address bug reports and comments to: particle@cpan.org. When
    sending bug reports, please provide the version of Test::Version, the
    version of Perl, and the name and version of the operating system you
    are using.
